This mod takes AA50-41 (World War 2 Version 3) and adds maintenance costs. Each units costs 1 PU, except infrastructure & transports are free and battleships cost 2.<br>
  To compensate for the higher costs, each playes receives 15 extra PU per turn<br>
  The US receives an additional bonus equal to the turn# (for the first 50 turns).<br>
  Each power except China receives 1 tech Token per turn.<br>
  China receives no tech, but each Chinese area has a 1/10 chance of generating an infantry each turn, even if not controlled.<br>
